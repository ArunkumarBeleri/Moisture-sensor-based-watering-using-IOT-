# Moisture-sensor-based-watering-using-IOT-
A moisture sensor-based IoT watering system monitors soil moisture and automates irrigation using a microcontroller, water pump, and Wi-Fi module. It prevents over/under-watering by sending real-time data to a cloud platform, enabling remote monitoring and control via a mobile app or web interface.
